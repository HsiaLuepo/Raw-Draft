Volume 1 is uncompleted so far.(AUG 21st 2020)

This is the first volume of "Kings Who Brought the Daylight."

I wrote it in Chinese,my native tongue,which makes it rather difficult to read for those who don't speak it.My using figure of speech frequently may have intensified such difficulty,too.

I may do the translation myself(if I have to).As you can see,however,I don't have a command of English good enough to do it perfectly.Anyone who feels like to help me with the translation could contact me on GitHub or via Email;I would appreciate that.



This volume,"A Visitor from the Illusory World",depicted the life of the unpriviledged,as well as their struggle,pain and helplessness created by the cruel Fate.Real life and other works of art gave me a great amount of source material.There are many philosophical discussions and scenery descriptions in this volume,which makes its plot less stronger.

Enjoy it as you like!
